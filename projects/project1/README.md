The Working Sisyphus - Liu WenYue
February 7th 2019

This game is based on the Sisyphusâ€™ story and it's called The Working Sisyphus. There is only one thing for the character to do in this game - to work. The players have to keep pressing spacebar to make the character to work. The working progress will increase as the spacebar is pressed. Once the working progress reaches 70%, coin (salary) will be generated at the right side of the screen. However,  the coin will disappear with a text notification of "tax paid!" when the character is just about to finish his work. As a result, the character has to start the whole working progress again and experience the pain over and over. This game is infinite and unstoppable.

The first thing that came to my mind when I read the Sisyphus' story is adult workers, be it factory workers or companies workers. So I came out with the scene of a working man in the setting of a factory-looking place. The character's stiff sitting posture suggests that the character is in this pose for a very long time. The glitched gears in the background also suggest that they've been enduring for an excessive amount of workload. The text notification is sarcasm to capitalism as the character (workers) didn't get what they deserved.

In the aesthetic aspect, the overall theme of this game is steampunk style and the color palette used is yellow and red hues. The radial gradient in the background brings players' attention to the center of the screen where the character, coin, and the starting dialog box will be located.

The background music of the game is an extract from one of the songs used in anime "Shiki" called "Dance of Death". I feel these four phrases are very clean and beautiful. At the same time, it also shows some feeling of desperation of the character. Moreover, these phrases stay in the same tone and loop itself which also shows the idea of infinite.

I encountered a lot of problems when I was arranging the elements as I planned to work with both p5 libraries and jQuery. I first used the p5.play.js to play my sequence animation, but it was very hard for me to put them inside a jQuery-based project. In the end, I re-exported my animation in the animated GIF format and cleared the background in Photoshop to have all the animations worked as desired.

From this project, I realized that I used to have a very "big" idea at the start of the project, but it may not work best with the required framework and it may be too challenging for me to finish the game within such a short period of time. For my future projects, I will be looking deeper into the theme of the project and the functionalities of the libraries and frameworks. Instead of telling a story, I will focus more on illustrating the ideas in the best possible simple way.
